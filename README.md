Blender Manager includes several powerful features designed to streamline project setup and tracking, all without the need to open Blender initially. Here’s a closer look at some of its standout functionalities:

### 1. **Project Time Tracking**
Blender Manager automatically tracks the time spent on each project, giving users a clear view of their work hours. This feature is integrated directly into the **Recent Projects** section, where the total time spent on a project is displayed. Users can monitor their productivity and get a detailed breakdown of working hours for each project, making it an excellent tool for both personal time management and client billing.

### 2. **Recent Projects Overview**
The **Recent Projects** feature provides a convenient list of previously opened Blender files, showing key details such as the project name, last opened date, and file path. Users can easily access their most recent work without manually searching through directories. This feature enhances workflow efficiency by allowing users to quickly resume their work from where they left off.

### 3. **Comprehensive Project Creation**
Blender Manager offers an advanced **Create Project** tool that allows users to set up their project environment without launching Blender. This includes:
   - **Reference Images Setup**: Users can import reference images for multiple views (front, back, left, right, top, and bottom). This ensures all necessary reference materials are organized and ready for modeling before opening the project in Blender.
   - **Base Mesh Selection**: Users can choose a base mesh from a predefined list or add their own custom base meshes. This allows for a quick start with pre-configured models, saving time during the initial stages of modeling.
   - **Scene Configuration**: Users can predefine scene elements such as adding a camera and lights, and configure autosave options (e.g., autosave interval, custom autosave directory). This makes the project ready for immediate work as soon as it is opened in Blender.

### 4. **Auto Update**:
   - Blender Manager includes an **Auto Update** feature, ensuring both the Blender application and Blender Manager itself are always up to date. The app automatically checks for the latest releases and offers a simple one-click update option. This feature saves time and guarantees access to the newest features and bug fixes without manual intervention.

### 5. **Customizable GUI**:
   - The user interface of Blender Manager is highly customizable. Users can choose from a variety of themes, adjust font sizes, and control the transparency of the app, allowing for a personalized and comfortable experience. The flexibility in GUI settings makes it easy for users to tailor the application to their preferences.

### 6. **Seamless Version Control**:
   - Blender Manager allows users to manage multiple Blender versions effortlessly. Users can install any version they need, switch between them, or set a specific version as the **Main Launch Version**. This feature is perfect for users who work on different projects requiring different Blender versions, making the transition between projects smooth and hassle-free.

### 7. **Multi-Platform Support (In Progress)**:
   - While the current version of Blender Manager is optimized for Windows, the application includes initial support for multi-platform functionality, with plans to expand full compatibility to macOS and Linux in future releases. This cross-platform support aims to provide a consistent experience for users regardless of their operating system.

### 8. **Addon Management**:
